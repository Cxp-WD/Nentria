# Nentria
### Open-Source Password Manager
Nentria is an open-source password manager that allows you to store and manage your passwords securely, without the need for centralized servers. It uses Quantum Secure End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) to protect your data, while syncing it across devices using your own cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox).

## Key Features
No Central Hosting: Nentria doesnâ€™t store your data on central servers. Your passwords are securely synced using your own cloud storage, ensuring complete control over your data.

Local Encrypted Backup: In addition to syncing via cloud, Nentria creates a local encrypted copy of your passwords on your device. This ensures that if cloud syncing fails, you still have access to your data, though syncing will be temporarily paused.

Cloud Flexibility: Choose your cloud provider (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) for syncing.

TOTP Support: Manage your time-based one-time passwords (2FA) directly within Nentria.

Passkeys: Embrace passwordless authentication with integrated passkey support.

Cross-Platform: Nentria is designed to work across devices, with plans to be available on Microsoft Store, Google Play Store, and Apple App Store.
